  Dr. Carter joined the Stony Brook University (SBU) faculty as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Molecular Genetics &amp; Microbiology, School of Medicine, after graduating from the City College of New York (Phi Beta Kappa), earning her PhD at Yale U and completing postdoctoral studies in virus replication and protein biochemistry at the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology.  At SBU, she advanced through the ranks to Professor and is an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Physiology &amp; Biophysics.  Dr. Carter leads a federally funded basic research program focused on the pathogenesis of AIDS and other viral-induced diseases and has served on the editorial boards of journals in her field and federal, state and private advisory committees.  Her research centers on cellular protein trafficking mechanisms necessary for production of virus particles and how they might be targeted for anti-viral drug design.   Aspects of her work have been exhibited in the Museum of Science &amp; Technology (Chicago IL, 2000) and translated into issued or pending patent/licenses.  Dr. Carter was a featured speaker at the “Women in Science” workshop sponsored by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (Japan, 2006), is a member of several SBU Graduate and Medical Sciences Training Programs in Infectious Diseases, Cancer, and Genetics and has participated in teaching of undergraduate, graduate, medical, and dental students.   She has been the recipient of the “SBU Exceptional Service to Undergraduate Education” award, was recognized by the office of the SBU President for her service in initiatives promoted by the Center for Inclusive Education, received the 2016 Suffolk County Public Service award and, for her translational work, the 2017 Long Island Innovator award.  She gratefully acknowledges the enthusiastic support and encouragement of the CSHL Director David Micklos and Assistant Director Jason Williams, without whose talents, dedication and commitment this opportunity could not have been developed.

  David Johnson is a rising 4th year graduate student at the Watson School of Biological Sciences at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He joined Dr. Alea Mills’s Lab in 2017 where his current thesis research involves implementing CRISPR technology to study epigenetic proteins in brain cancer. David graduated from Brown University Class of 2016 where he attained his Sc.B in Neuroscience. Whilst at Brown, he was a Minority Peer Counselor, where he was trained in implementing safe spaces for URMs students at and responsible for understanding and addressing the various “-isms” (racism, sexism, classism, ableism, etc). Additionally, he was chosen to be part of the New Scientist Program which is designed to support URMs undergraduate students pursuing a degree in STEM. During his senior year, David was chosen to be Head Coordinator of the New Scientist Program along with 3 of his peers. As head coordinator he and his peers were responsible for training mentors, as well as establishing and maintaining mentorships for 60-70 students. Currently, David Johnson, is co-president of DIAS (Diversity Initiative for the Advancement of STEM) a student run group at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory whose purpose is to provide and advocate for a safe space for URM scientists. Last but not least, David is an accomplished graduate student who was awarded the NSF GRFP in 2017, and this year was awarded the HHMI Gilliam Fellowship.

  Brittany is a Middle School Educator at the DNA Learning Center. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Biology from Fisk University, and a Master of Biological Medical Sciences from Mississippi College. Brittany’s involvement with the DNALC began when she participated in a Summer DNA Program creating antibiotic resistant genes held at Central Islip High School. She was grateful for the teachers who made sure and others had the opportunity and exposure to this style of learning. Later, while volunteering in the then Central Islip School District (CISD) Mulligan Science Center a DNALC Educator came to do a lab, eventually leading her to pursue an opportunity to start a career with the DNALC team. The DNA Learning Center sparked an interest she never forgot, and as an educator, it is her aspiration to encourage critical thinking, while creating an environment and an excitement for learning.

<p>Thank you to the various supporters who have made it possible for us to make
this idea a reality. Their support enabled us to refine our ideas for the
camp, recruit students, and develop the curriculum. We also want to acknowledge
others possibly not listed here who contributed in other ways including teachers
and advisors who helped spread the word, administrators who helped distribute
flyers, and anyone else who helped behind the scenes.</p>

<h2 id="david-micklos">David Micklos</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.dnalc.org/about/staff/micklos.html">David Micklos</a> is the Founder and Executive Director of the Cold Spring Harbor <a href="https://www.dnalc.org/about/staff/micklos.html">DNA Learning Center</a>. His support has made it possible for
us to hold this first year of the STARS program without any external funding
for supplies and staff time. He originally conceived of the idea of holding
a dedicated DNALC camp that would serve to support underrepresented students in
STEM and embraced the opportunity to collaborate with Professor Carter and her colleagues at Stony Brook University, who were seeking a setting for such an initiative.</p>
