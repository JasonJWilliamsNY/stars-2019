Since it is not for public consumption, there are abbreviations and reference
that are not fully documented.</p>

<p><strong>Reagent quantities/students</strong>: This course will be for 26 students, so all
labs should be prepared for 30 student experiments (unless otherwise noted).</p>

<p><strong>For week one</strong>: Materials should be available in the Delbrück lab the afternoon
before for inspection by the instructor.</p>

<h1 id="2019-stars-camp-intern-assignments">2019 STARS Camp Intern Assignments</h1>

<p><strong>Assignment list</strong></p>

<p>The named intern is responsible for reporting to the instructor when they arrive.
   If a different intern is assigned a shift and that intern does not arrive, please
   inform the instructor.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>AM Drop off</strong>: Parents/gaurdians will be dropping off students at XXX. Interns should
be visable and acknowledge parents while dropping off their child. During
the week of 8/19 will not be able to drive down to Bungtown Rd. Therefore
interns should wait with all students at the entrance to Bush lecuture hall.
Once all students have arrived, the instructor will escort them to Delbrück.
If a student has not arrived by 9:30, the intern should inform the DNALC
main office (516-367-5170 or 5170 from a CSHL phone) who will attempt to
contact the parent. By 9:45 the intern may head to Delbrück if there is no
indication the missing student is on the way.</p>

    <p>Once arrived students may not leave the supervison of the intern. There
are bathrooms in Bush lecture hall for anyone needing them, but they should
not be allowed to roam unspervised (e.g. to purchase food at Blackford, etc.).
Students arriving early can purchase food at Blackford if they are escorted
by a parent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>AM Laboratory</strong>: This intern will be present in the laboratory at all times.
they should keep an eye on students and may assist them with their tasks (i.e.
pipetting, running gels, etc.). Interns should be mindful of student’s whereabouts,
including any students that may be taking a long time to return from the
restroom.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lunch Cover</strong>: This intern is responsible for supervision of students during
their lunch period. Students on the CSHL campus will bring their lunches and
will not be allowed to go off and purchase lunch on their own. If a student
has forgotten lunch, we will help make sure they are provided for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>PM Laboratory</strong>: This intern will be present in the laboratory at all times.
they should keep an eye on students and may assist them with their tasks (i.e.
pipetting, running gels, etc.). Interns should be mindful of student’s whereabouts,
including any students that may be taking a long time to return from the
restroom.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>PM Pickup</strong>: This intern be present to supervise the pick up of each student.
They should verify that each student has been picked up and should acknowledge
the parent/guardian who is picking up the student. If a parent is late for a
pickup, the intern will ensure the instructor/DNALC Main office is informed
to contact the parent and get the updated pickup time. Interns may not leave
until they have the instructor’s permission.</p>

<p>Since this will be at DNALC we only need one intern assigned per day. This will
be mostly a computer lab and intern will not need to attend every momemnt of
the camp, but can be on call as needed.</p>
