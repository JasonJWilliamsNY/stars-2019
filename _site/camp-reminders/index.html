    <h1 id="safety-reminders">Safety reminders</h1>

<p>Your child’s saftey is our first concern. Please go over the following reminders
with your child.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>All students are required to be supervised at all times by either
one of the <a href="https://jasonjwilliamsny.github.io/stars-2019/2019-instructors/">instructors</a> or
by a camp intern (interns will be wearing light-blue shirts with the
DNA Learning Center Summer Camp logo).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Students are not allowed to leave the CSHL main campus or the buildings/lab
areas where class activities are being conducted. In week two, 11th/12th grade
students may walk to the Delicatessen on Main Street with parent’s permission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Students are expected to comply with all instructor and intern instructions.
Students who do not comply, or engage in any dangerous, distracting, or disruptive
behavior will be dismissed from further participation in the course, and parents
will be asked to pick up their child as soon as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To maintain a safe environment in the laboratory, students should avoid open-toed
shoes (sandles). Shorts are permissable, but should not be overly short. We will
not be working with dangerous laboratory equipment or chemicals, but we are preparing
students for future work where laboratory dress code and protective equipment
will be required (See <a href="https://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHA3404laboratory-safety-guidance.pdf">OSHA standards</a> - or, a good short summary of common
lab dress standards <a href="https://ehs.stonybrook.edu/programs/laboratory-safety/personal-protective-equipment/appropriate-clothing-laboratories.php">Stony Brook EHS</a>).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="conduct-expectations">Conduct expectations</h1>

<p>During this course all students are expected to conduct themselves in a way that is respectful of their fellow students and the learning environment. Failure to observe these rules may result in warnings and/or dismissal from the class.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone can learn something from this class and has a right to do so in a safe and welcoming environment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone is to be treated with respect - there should be no name calling, insults, bullying, and/or profanity. If your jokes or other behavior makes other students or instructors uncomfortable, you must stop (and appropriately apologize) when asked to do so.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone comes to this class with different background knowledge and experience. Disparaging remarks about anyone’s performance in the class are not allowed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During instructional time, the use of cell phones or internet browsing unrelated to the course should be limited. Students are not permitted to visit inappropriate sites and must make responsible use of the internet.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
