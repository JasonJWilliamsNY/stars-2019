# Setting up for your first use

We will mostly be using [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to do coding
in this class. Here are some setup instructions for download these notebooks.

1. Login to the Jupyter hub at the URL given to you by your instructor.

2. Start a new terminal by going to **New** in the drop-down menus and selecting
   **Terminal**

   <img src="../img/hubhomepage.png" alt="Hub homepage" style="width:600px;height:150px;">

3. Copy the following code to your clipboard. At the terminal paste in the
   command and hit enter (remember to highlight the whole line, you
   can double-click to highlight all):

      ```
      git clone https://github.com/JasonJWilliamsNY/biocoding-2019-notebooks.git
      ```

    You should get an output that looks something like:

    ```
    Cloning into 'biocoding-2019-notebooks'...
    remote: Enumerating objects: 88, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (88/88), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (83/83), done.
    remote: Total 88 (delta 1), reused 85 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
    Unpacking objects: 100% (88/88), done.
    ```

You are now ready to continue on with the course!
